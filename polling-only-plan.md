## Conclusion

This plan provides a systematic approach to resolving the socket parse errors by addressing the most likely causes first (transport issues and message validation) and then investigating secondary causes. The polling-only approach should provide immediate stability while allowing for thorough investigation of the root causes.

The phased approach ensures that each potential cause is thoroughly investigated and tested before moving to the next phase, minimizing the risk of introducing new issues while resolving the existing parse errors.
