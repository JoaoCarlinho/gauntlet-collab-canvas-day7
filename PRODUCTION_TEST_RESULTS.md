- **24-object-visibility-test-start.png**: Ready for object testing
- **33-not-authenticated-for-objects.png**: Object test without auth

## 🔍 Key Findings

### ✅ **Positive Results**

1. **Production App Health**: 
   - Application loads successfully
   - UI elements are properly rendered
   - Sign-in button is functional

2. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Cypress tests run successfully against production
   - Screenshots are captured correctly
   - Error handling works as expected

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Sign-in button is clickable
   - Redirect to Google OAuth is initiated
   - Manual authentication is required (expected)

### ⚠️ **Areas Requiring Manual Testing**

1. **Authentication**: Requires manual login as JSkeete@gmail.com
2. **Canvas Deletion**: Needs authentication to test fully
3. **Canvas Creation**: Needs authentication to test fully
4. **Real-time Features**: Needs authentication to test fully
5. **Object Visibility**: Needs authentication to test fully

## 🎯 Next Steps for Complete Validation

### Manual Authentication Required
To complete the validation, you need to:

1. **Run Interactive Tests**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:production:open
   ```

2. **Manual Authentication Steps**:
   - When the test opens, click "Sign in with Google"
   - Login as `JSkeete@gmail.com`
   - Complete the OAuth flow
   - Let the tests continue automatically

3. **Expected Results After Authentication**:
   - Canvas deletion functionality will be tested
   - Canvas creation will be validated
   - Real-time collaboration will be tested
   - Object visibility will be verified
