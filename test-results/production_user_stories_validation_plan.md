# Production User Stories Validation Plan

## 🎯 **Testing Objectives**

Validate all 13 user stories in the production environment to ensure the application works correctly for end users.

## 📋 **User Stories to Validate**

### **Authentication & Canvas Management**
1. ✅ A user can login with passkey
2. ✅ A user can create a canvas and give it a name and description
3. ✅ A user can see a list of created canvasses
4. ✅ A user can open a canvas for updating

### **Canvas Object Placement**
5. ✅ A user can place a text-box on the canvas and enter text into the text box
6. ✅ A user can place a star on the canvas and the star take the shape of a five-point star and the star remains visible
7. ✅ A user can place a circle on the canvas and the circle remains visible
8. ✅ A user can place a rectangle on the canvas and the rectangle remains visible
9. ✅ A user can place a line on the canvas and the line remains visible
10. ✅ A user can place an arrow on the canvas and the arrow remains visible
11. ✅ A user can place a diamond on the canvas and the diamond remains visible

### **Canvas Object Manipulation**
12. ✅ A user can resize any shape placed on the canvas

### **AI Agent Integration**
13. ✅ A user can send a message to an AI Agent and request a canvas to be generated and this canvas will be presented in the browser

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Environment Setup**
- Verify production deployment is running
- Check API endpoints are accessible
- Validate Socket.IO connection
- Test authentication flow

### **Phase 2: Authentication & Canvas Management**
- Test passkey login
- Test canvas creation
- Test canvas listing
- Test canvas opening

### **Phase 3: Canvas Object Placement**
- Test all shape types (text, star, circle, rectangle, line, arrow, diamond)
- Verify objects persist on canvas
- Test real-time updates
- Validate Socket.IO object creation

### **Phase 4: Canvas Object Manipulation**
- Test object resizing
- Verify resize persistence
- Test real-time resize updates

### **Phase 5: AI Agent Integration**
- Test AI agent communication
- Test canvas generation
- Verify AI-generated objects appear on canvas

## 📊 **Success Criteria**

### **Authentication**
- ✅ User can login with passkey
- ✅ User session is maintained
- ✅ Protected routes are accessible

### **Canvas Management**
- ✅ Canvas creation works
- ✅ Canvas listing displays correctly
- ✅ Canvas opening works
- ✅ Canvas data persists

### **Object Placement**

- ✅ Real-time resize updates work

### **AI Agent**
- ✅ AI agent responds to messages
- ✅ AI-generated canvas appears
- ✅ AI objects are placed on canvas

## 🚀 **Execution Plan**

1. **Deploy Latest Changes** - Ensure all fixes are deployed
2. **Run Production Tests** - Execute comprehensive test suite
3. **Validate User Stories** - Test each user story systematically
4. **Document Results** - Record pass/fail status for each story
5. **Generate Report** - Create comprehensive validation report
