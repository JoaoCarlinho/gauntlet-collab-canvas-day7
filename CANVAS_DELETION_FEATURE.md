# Canvas Deletion Feature

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the canvas deletion functionality in the CollabCanvas application. Users can now delete canvases they own directly from the canvas list interface.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Delete Button on Canvas Cards
- **Location**: Top-right corner of each canvas card
- **Visibility**: Only shown for canvases owned by the current user
- **Interaction**: Appears on hover or focus for accessibility
- **Icon**: Trash2 icon from Lucide React
- **Styling**: Subtle gray color that turns red on hover

### 2. Delete Confirmation Modal
- **Purpose**: Prevents accidental deletions
- **Content**: 
  - Clear warning message
  - Canvas title confirmation
  - Explanation that action cannot be undone
- **Actions**: Cancel and Delete buttons
- **Loading State**: Shows spinner and "Deleting..." text during deletion

### 3. State Management
- **Local State Updates**: Canvas is immediately removed from the list after successful deletion
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with toast notifications
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during deletion process

### 4. Security
- **Backend Validation**: Only canvas owners can delete their canvases
- **Frontend Validation**: Delete button only shown for owned canvases
- **API Integration**: Uses existing `canvasAPI.deleteCanvas()` method

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes

#### HomePage.tsx
- Added new state variables:
  - `showDeleteModal`: Controls delete confirmation modal visibility
  - `canvasToDelete`: Stores the canvas to be deleted
  - `isDeleting`: Tracks deletion loading state

- Added new functions:
  - `handleDeleteClick()`: Opens delete confirmation modal
  - `handleDeleteConfirm()`: Executes canvas deletion
  - `handleDeleteCancel()`: Closes delete confirmation modal

- Updated UI:
  - Modified canvas card structure to include delete button
  - Added delete confirmation modal
  - Enhanced keyboard navigation for both modals

#### Key Features:
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management
- **User Experience**: Hover states, loading indicators, clear feedback
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications for success/error states

### Backend Integration
- Uses existing `DELETE /canvas/<canvas_id>` endpoint
- Leverages existing `canvasAPI.deleteCanvas()` method
- No backend changes required

## Testing

### Cypress Tests
Created comprehensive test suite in `canvas-deletion.cy.ts`:

1. **Delete Button Visibility**: Verifies delete button only shows for owned canvases
2. **Confirmation Modal**: Tests modal appearance and content
3. **Canvas Deletion**: Tests successful deletion flow
4. **Error Handling**: Tests loading states and error scenarios

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run canvas deletion tests
npm run test:canvas-deletion

# Open Cypress UI for canvas deletion tests
npm run test:canvas-deletion:open
```

## User Experience

### Visual Design
- **Subtle Integration**: Delete button doesn't interfere with main card functionality
- **Clear Feedback**: Loading states and success/error messages
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches existing design system

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactions
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus trapping in modals

### Error Prevention
- **Confirmation Required**: No accidental deletions
- **Clear Warnings**: Users understand the permanent nature of deletion
- **Graceful Failures**: Proper error handling and user feedback

## Security Considerations

### Frontend Security
- Delete button only shown for owned canvases
- Proper event handling to prevent navigation conflicts

### Backend Security
- Server-side validation ensures only owners can delete
- Proper authentication required for all delete operations

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Bulk Deletion**: Allow deletion of multiple canvases at once
2. **Soft Delete**: Option to restore deleted canvases
3. **Deletion History**: Track and display deletion history
4. **Advanced Permissions**: Allow collaborators to delete with proper permissions

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Optimistic Updates**: Remove from UI immediately, rollback on error
2. **Caching**: Better cache invalidation after deletions
3. **Batch Operations**: Support for multiple operations

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to the canvas list (home page)
2. Hover over a canvas you own
3. Click the trash icon that appears
4. Confirm deletion in the modal
5. Canvas is permanently removed

### For Developers
- All functionality is contained within `HomePage.tsx`
- Uses existing API endpoints and services
- Follows established patterns for modals and state management
- Comprehensive test coverage included

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/HomePage.tsx` - Main implementation
- `frontend/cypress/e2e/canvas-deletion.cy.ts` - Test suite
- `frontend/package.json` - Added test scripts

## Files Not Modified
- Backend API (already supported deletion)
- Other frontend components
- Database schema
- Authentication system

This implementation provides a complete, user-friendly canvas deletion feature that integrates seamlessly with the existing application architecture.
