# CRITICAL: Railway Deployment Not Updating - Object Placement Completely Broken

**Date:** October 27, 2025, ~7:24 AM PDT
**Status:** CRITICAL - Users cannot place objects on canvas
**Pushed Commit:** 090aee6 "URGENT: Force Railway rebuild"

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL BUG:** Railway backend is running OLD CODE despite multiple commits being pushed to master branch. This is causing object placement to completely fail.

**Root Cause:** Railway either:
1. Not detecting commits to master branch
2. Using cached build that doesn't include latest changes
3. Build/deployment pipeline stuck

**Evidence:** Console logs show schema validation errors that were fixed 9 commits ago.

---

## The Smoking Gun

### Frontend Console Shows Latest Code:
```
Git Commit: b1693ad  ← Correct, latest
Build Time: 2025-10-27T07:18:13.578Z
```

### Backend Behavior Shows Old Code:
```javascript
Error message: {'_token_metadata': ['Unknown field.']}
```

**This error was fixed in commit 58f9370** (9 commits ago!) by adding `_token_metadata` to all schema classes. Railway is NOT running this fix.

---

## Complete Error Analysis

### Error 1: Schema Validation Blocking Cursor Movement

**Console Error:**
```
{'_token_metadata': ['Unknown field.']}
```

**What This Means:**
- Token optimization service adds `_token_metadata` to Socket.IO messages
- Backend schema rejects this field as "unknown"
- Fixed in commit 58f9370 by adding field to schemas
- **Railway is NOT running this fix**

**Impact:** Every cursor movement triggers validation error

---

### Error 2: Authentication Context Lost

**Console Error:**
```
Error message: User or canvas ID missing
```

**Railway Backend Log:**
```
Socket.IO authentication failed: Token has expired. Please refresh your authentication.
(repeated 119 times in logs)
```

**What This Means:**
- Users connect successfully but tokens expire
- Socket.IO events don't have authentication context
- Backend treats events as anonymous
- Permission check fails: "User or canvas ID missing"

**Impact:** Cannot place objects, all authenticated actions fail

---

### Error 3: REST API Authentication Failures

**Network Logs:**
```
GET /api/canvas/c3dc7e0d-6a37-47d5-b2cc-511999306939/objects → 401
(repeated dozens of times)
```

**What This Means:**
- REST API calls also failing authentication
- Token either expired or not being sent correctly
- 401 Unauthorized errors on every canvas object request

**Impact:** Cannot load existing canvas objects

---

## Why Railway Isn't Deploying

### Railway Configuration ([railway.json](railway.json)):
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile.railway"
  },
  "watch": {
    "include": ["backend/**"]
  }
}
```

**Configuration is correct:**
- Watches `backend/**` directory ✅
- Commit 58f9370 changed `backend/app/schemas/socket_validation_schemas.py` ✅
- Should have triggered rebuild ✅

**Possible Issues:**
1. Railway webhook not receiving push events from GitHub
2. Railway build cache ignoring source changes
3. Railway deployment stuck/frozen
4. Railway using wrong branch (but git shows master is correct)
5. Dockerfile cache preventing rebuild

---

## Deployment Pipeline Analysis

### Dockerfile Process:
```dockerfile
# Step 1: Use Python 3.11 slim base
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Step 2: Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc g++ libpq-dev curl

# Step 3: Copy requirements
COPY backend/requirements.txt .

# Step 4: Install Python packages
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 5: Copy application code ← CRITICAL STEP
COPY backend/ .

# Step 6: Run
CMD ["python", "run.py"]
```

**Critical Step (Line 41):** `COPY backend/ .`
- Should copy ALL files from backend/ directory
- Includes schemas/socket_validation_schemas.py with fixes
- Docker layer caching might prevent re-copy if it thinks nothing changed

---

## Fix Attempts Made

### Attempt 1-3: Empty Commits
- Created empty commits to trigger deployment
- Railway ignored these (possibly because no files in `backend/**` changed)

### Attempt 4: Modify backend/run.py (CURRENT)
- Added comment line to backend/run.py
- Forces `backend/**` directory to have actual file change
- Should invalidate Docker layer cache
- **Waiting for Railway to detect and rebuild...**

---

## Expected Behavior After Successful Deployment

### 1. Schema Validation Errors Gone
**Before:**
```
{'_token_metadata': ['Unknown field.']}
```

**After:**
```
(no error - field accepted by schema)
```

### 2. Debug Logging Appears
**New logs should show:**
```
Socket event authentication check - Session keys: [...]
Socket event authentication check - Data keys: [...]
Socket event authentication check - Has id_token: True/False
```

### 3. Authentication Works (Maybe)
**If id_token is present in data:**
- Fallback authentication should work
- `_authenticated_user` added to data
- Permission checks pass
- Object placement succeeds

**If id_token still missing:**
- Need additional fix to preserve token through validation
- Will see from debug logs

---

## User Impact

### What Users Currently See:

1. **Loading Screen:** Page loads, authentication succeeds
2. **Canvas Loads:** Canvas UI appears
3. **Move Cursor:** Console floods with `_token_metadata` errors
4. **Try to Place Object:** Silent failure with "User or canvas ID missing"
5. **Refresh Page:** Token expires, forced to re-authenticate
6. **Infinite Loop:** Repeat steps 1-5

### What Users SHOULD See:

1. Load page → Authenticate → Canvas loads ✅
2. Move cursor → No errors ✅
3. Place object → Object appears on canvas ✅
4. Other users see object in real-time ✅

---

## Technical Deep Dive

### Why Schema Validation Matters

**Token Optimization Flow:**
```python
# In token_optimization_service.py:
def add_optimization_metadata(data, token):
    # Add metadata to track token optimization
    data['_token_metadata'] = {
        'exp_time': token_exp,
        'time_to_expiry': time_to_expiry,
        'optimization_score': score
    }
    return data

# Data sent to Socket.IO:
{
    'canvas_id': 'abc123',
    'id_token': 'eyJ...',
    'object': {...},
    '_token_metadata': {...}  ← Added by optimization service
}
```

**Schema Validation (OLD CODE - BROKEN):**
```python
class ObjectCreateEventSchema(BaseSocketEventSchema):
    canvas_id = fields.Str(required=True)
    id_token = fields.Str(required=True)
    object = fields.Dict(required=True)
    # _token_metadata field NOT DEFINED ❌

    class Meta:
        unknown = EXCLUDE  # Reject unknown fields ❌
```

**Result:** `{'_token_metadata': ['Unknown field.']}`

**Schema Validation (NEW CODE - FIXED in 58f9370):**
```python
class ObjectCreateEventSchema(BaseSocketEventSchema):
    canvas_id = fields.Str(required=True)
    id_token = fields.Str(required=True)
    object = fields.Dict(required=True)
    _token_metadata = fields.Dict(required=False)  ← NOW DEFINED ✅
    _authenticated_user = fields.Dict(required=False)  ← ALSO ADDED ✅

    class Meta:
        unknown = INCLUDE  # Allow unknown fields ✅
```

**Result:** Validation passes, data preserved through pipeline ✅

---

### Why Authentication Fails

**Decorator Chain:**
```python
# From socket_security.py apply_socket_security():
if schema_class:
    func = validate_socket_input(schema_class)(func)  # 1. VALIDATE

func = require_socket_auth(func)                      # 2. AUTHENTICATE
func = check_canvas_permission_decorator(permission)(func)  # 3. AUTHORIZE
func = rate_limit_socket_event(event_type)(func)     # 4. RATE LIMIT
```

**Step 1: Validation (OLD CODE - BROKEN):**
```python
def validate_socket_input(schema_class):
    def wrapper(data, *args, **kwargs):
        schema = schema_class()
        validated_data = schema.load(data)
        # ❌ Rejects _token_metadata
        # ❌ Validation fails, emits error
        # ❌ Never reaches authentication step
```

**Step 2: Authentication (NEVER REACHED):**
```python
def require_socket_auth(func):
    def wrapper(data, *args, **kwargs):
        # Check session
        user_data = session.get('authenticated_user')

        if not user_data:
            # Fallback to id_token
            id_token = data.get('id_token')
            # Validate token, add _authenticated_user to data
```

**Step 3: Authorization (NEVER REACHED):**
```python
def check_canvas_permission_decorator(permission):
    def wrapper(data, *args, **kwargs):
        user = data.get('_authenticated_user')
        if not user:
            emit('error', {'message': 'User or canvas ID missing'})
```

**The Problem:**
- Validation fails BEFORE authentication runs
- Request never reaches permission check
- User never added to data
- "User or canvas ID missing" error

## What Commit 090aee6 Does

### File Changed: backend/run.py

**Before:**
```python
import os
from app import create_app, socketio
from app.config import DevelopmentConfig, ProductionConfig, TestingConfig

# Load environment variables from .env file
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# Determine configuration based on environment
```

**After:**
```python
import os
from app import create_app, socketio
from app.config import DevelopmentConfig, ProductionConfig, TestingConfig

# Load environment variables from .env file
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# Deployment marker: b1693ad - Force Railway to rebuild with latest schema fixes

# Determine configuration based on environment
```

**Why This Helps:**
1. Creates real file change in `backend/` directory
2. Railway's watch pattern `backend/**` should detect this
3. Docker layer cache invalidated for `COPY backend/ .` step
4. Forces complete rebuild from scratch
5. New build includes all commits since last successful deploy

---

## Verification Steps After Deployment

### Step 1: Check Railway Logs for New Container

Look for fresh startup sequence:
```
Starting Container
✅ Database connected successfully!
Cache initialization successful with Redis-compatible wrapper
```

Note the timestamp - should be AFTER 7:24 AM PDT.

### Step 2: Try to Move Cursor on Canvas

**Watch console for:**
- ❌ `{'_token_metadata': ['Unknown field.']}` → OLD CODE STILL RUNNING
- ✅ No validation errors → NEW CODE DEPLOYED

### Step 3: Look for Debug Logging

**Should see in Railway logs:**
```
Socket event authentication check - Session keys: [...]
Socket event authentication check - Data keys: [...]
Socket event authentication check - Has id_token: True/False
```

If these appear → NEW CODE DEPLOYED

### Step 4: Try to Place Object

**Console should show:**
- ✅ No errors → Object placement working
- ❌ "User or canvas ID missing" → Authentication still broken (but schema fixed)

---

## Next Steps Based on Deployment Outcome

### Scenario A: Deployment Succeeds, Schema Fixed, Objects Placeable ✅
**Result:** Issue completely resolved!
**Action:** Monitor for any edge cases

### Scenario B: Deployment Succeeds, Schema Fixed, Authentication Still Fails
**Debug logging shows:** `Has id_token: False`
**Root Cause:** Token being stripped during validation/sanitization
**Fix Required:** Modify sanitization to preserve id_token

### Scenario C: Deployment Succeeds, Schema Fixed, Token Present But Auth Fails
**Debug logging shows:** `Has id_token: True`
**Root Cause:** Token validation or user lookup failing
**Fix Required:** Debug auth_service.verify_token() and get_user_by_id()

### Scenario D: Deployment STILL Fails (Railway Not Rebuilding)
**Evidence:** `_token_metadata` errors persist
**Actions:**
1. Check Railway dashboard manually
2. Manually trigger deployment via Railway UI
3. Check Railway webhook settings
4. Check Railway build logs for errors
5. Contact Railway support if needed

---

## Manual Railway Deployment (If Automated Fails)

If Railway doesn't auto-deploy commit 090aee6:

1. **Login to Railway Dashboard:** https://railway.app
2. **Select Project:** collabcanvas-mvp-day7 (or similar)
3. **Navigate to Backend Service**
4. **Check "Deployments" Tab:**
   - Should show new deployment in progress
   - If not, check "Settings" tab
5. **Manual Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy" button in top right
   - Or: Settings → GitHub → "Redeploy Latest"
6. **Force Rebuild:**
   - Settings → "Variables" → Add dummy variable → Remove it
   - This forces complete rebuild

## Railway Configuration to Review

### railway.json
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile.railway"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 5,
    "startCommand": "python run.py"
  },
  "watch": {
    "include": ["backend/**"]  ← Watching correct directory
  }
}
```

### GitHub Integration
- Check: Railway has read access to repo
- Check: Webhook is active (GitHub repo Settings → Webhooks)
- Check: Railway is monitoring correct branch (should be `master`)

---

## Summary

**Current Status:**
- Railway backend running OLD CODE (pre-commit 58f9370)
- Schema validation rejecting `_token_metadata`
- Object placement completely non-functional
- Just pushed commit 090aee6 to force rebuild

**Waiting For:**
- Railway to detect commit 090aee6
- Railway to rebuild Docker image
- Railway to deploy new container
- Should happen within 2-5 minutes

**Expected After Deployment:**
- Schema validation errors gone
- Debug logging appears
- Can diagnose remaining authentication issues
- Possibly object placement fully working

**Timestamp:** October 27, 2025, 7:24 AM PDT
**Next Check:** 7:30 AM PDT (6 minutes from push)
