# URGENT: Manual Railway Deployment Required

**Date:** October 27, 2025, ~8:15 AM PDT
**Status:** CRITICAL - Auto-deployment completely broken
**Impact:** Object placement non-functional for all users

---

## Executive Summary

**Railway's auto-deployment has failed 10+ consecutive times.** The fix for object placement (commit 52c2c21) is committed, pushed to master, but Railway refuses to deploy it.

**You must manually deploy via Railway dashboard.**

---

## Evidence of Deployment Failure

### Commits Pushed to origin/master (All Ignored by Railway)
```
625c0e4 - FORCE RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT (8:08 AM) ❌ NOT DEPLOYED
52c2c21 - CRITICAL FIX: Preserve id_token (7:50 AM) ❌ NOT DEPLOYED
4241c78 - Disable token metadata (7:35 AM) ✅ DEPLOYED
090aee6 - Force Railway rebuild (7:24 AM) ❌ NOT DEPLOYED
b1693ad - Trigger Railway deployment (7:05 AM) ❌ NOT DEPLOYED
(... 5 more failed deployments before this)
```

### Current Backend Behavior (Proves Old Code Running)
**Railway logs show (lines 25-36):**
```
Anonymous rate limit exceeded for IP 100.64.0.4 on event object_created
```

**This should NOT happen if fix was deployed** - events should be authenticated, not anonymous.

### Frontend vs Backend Mismatch
- **Frontend:** Running commit 625c0e4 (latest) ✅
- **Backend:** Running commit ~4241c78 or earlier ❌
- **Proof:** No debug messages from 52c2c21 in Railway logs

---

## The Fix That Needs to Deploy

### File: `backend/app/middleware/socket_security.py`
### Lines: 270-287

**The Change:**
```python
def sanitize_socket_event_data(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # NEW: Skip sanitization for authentication tokens
    SKIP_SANITIZATION_FIELDS = {
        'id_token',  # Firebase JWT - must not be modified ✅
        'canvas_id', 'object_id', 'user_id',
        '_token_metadata', '_authenticated_user'
    }

    sanitized = {}
    for key, value in data.items():
        if key in SKIP_SANITIZATION_FIELDS:
            sanitized[key] = value  # Preserve exactly ✅
        elif isinstance(value, str):
            sanitized[key] = SanitizationService.sanitize_html(value)
        # ... rest of code
```

**Why This Fixes Object Placement:**
1. `id_token` no longer destroyed by sanitization
2. Authentication succeeds via fallback method
3. User identified on Socket.IO events
4. Permission checks pass
5. Object placement works

---

## Manual Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to:** https://railway.app
2. **Navigate to:** Your project → Backend service
3. **Click:** "Deployments" tab
4. **Action:** Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy" button (top right)
5. **Select:** Deploy from branch "master"
6. **Wait:** 2-3 minutes for build to complete
7. **Verify:** Check logs for new container start

### Option 2: Railway CLI (If Dashboard Fails)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Trigger deployment
railway up

# Or force redeploy
railway redeploy
```

### Option 3: Restart Service (Quick but may not pull latest code)

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Navigate to backend service
3. Click "Settings" tab
4. Scroll down to "Service"
5. Click "Restart" button

---

## Verification After Manual Deployment

### Step 1: Check Railway Logs
Look for:
```
Starting Container
✅ Database connected successfully!
```

Timestamp should be AFTER 8:15 AM PDT.

### Step 2: Look for Debug Messages (Proof of New Code)
Should see in logs:
```
Socket event authentication check - Session keys: [...]
Socket event authentication check - Has id_token: True
Fallback authentication successful for user: jskeete@gmail.com
Socket event authenticated for user: jskeete@gmail.com (method: fallback_token)
```

### Step 3: Check for Anonymous Rate Limiting (Should Be Gone)
Should NOT see:
```
Anonymous rate limit exceeded for IP
```

### Step 4: Test Object Placement
1. Sign in to canvas
2. Select rectangle tool
3. Click on canvas
4. **Rectangle should appear** ✅

### Step 5: Check Console Errors (Should Be Gone)
Should NOT see:
```
Error message: User or canvas ID missing
```

---

## Root Cause of Object Placement Failure

### The Bug
**File:** `backend/app/middleware/socket_security.py` (OLD CODE)
**Line:** 272-274

```python
for key, value in data.items():
    if isinstance(value, str):
        # This was running on EVERY string including id_token ❌
        sanitized[key] = SanitizationService.sanitize_html(value)
```

### The Impact
1. Frontend sends valid JWT: `eyJhbGci...valid.jwt.token`
2. Schema validation passes ✅
3. **Sanitization destroys JWT format** ❌
4. Authentication fails: "Invalid token"
5. Backend treats user as anonymous
6. Anonymous rate limit blocks all actions
7. Error: "User or canvas ID missing"

### The Complete Failure Chain
```
Frontend → Schema Validation ✅ → Sanitization ❌ → Authentication ❌ → Permission Check ❌ → Object Placement ❌
```

## Why Railway Auto-Deployment Is Broken

### Configuration Appears Correct
**File:** `railway.json`
```json
{
  "watch": {
    "include": ["backend/**"]  ← Should trigger on backend changes
  }
}
```

### Commits Changed backend/ Directory
```bash
$ git show 52c2c21 --stat
backend/app/middleware/socket_security.py | 26 +++++++++++++++++++++-----
1 file changed, 21 insertions(+), 5 deletions(-)
```

### Possible Causes
1. **Railway webhook not receiving GitHub push events**
   - Check GitHub repo Settings → Webhooks
   - Look for Railway webhook
   - Check recent deliveries for failures

2. **Railway build cache stuck**
   - Old Docker layers being reused
   - Source code not being re-copied
   - Manual deployment should force clean build

3. **Railway watching wrong branch**
   - Verify Railway is monitoring "master" branch
   - Check Railway project Settings → GitHub

4. **Railway service suspended/paused**
   - Check Railway dashboard for service status
   - Verify service is "Active"

5. **Railway build failing silently**
   - Check Railway build logs
   - Look for Docker build errors
   - Verify no step is failing and being cached

---

## Post-Deployment Actions

### Immediate (After Successful Deployment)

1. ✅ Test object placement thoroughly
2. ✅ Test cursor movement (no errors)
3. ✅ Test with multiple users
4. ✅ Verify objects persist after refresh

### Short Term (Within 24 Hours)

1. **Fix Railway Auto-Deployment**
   - Investigate webhook configuration
   - Check Railway service settings
   - May need Railway support ticket

2. **Re-enable Token Metadata** (Once deployment working)
   - Revert commit 4241c78
   - Re-deploy with schema fixes
   - Restore token optimization metrics

3. **Fix Cache Comparison Bug**
   - Still seeing: `Cache set error: '>' not supported`
   - Deploy cache fixes from commit 04a5058

### Medium Term (Within Week)

1. **Add Deployment Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for failed deployments
   - Monitor Railway webhook deliveries
   - Add deployment health checks

2. **Add Tests**
   - Unit tests for sanitization
   - Integration tests for authentication
   - E2E tests for object placement

3. **Improve Error Messages**
   - "User or canvas ID missing" too vague
   - Should be: "Authentication failed: Invalid token format"
   - Helps debug faster

## Alternative: Deploy to Different Platform

If Railway continues to fail, consider:

### Render.com
- Better deployment reliability
- Similar pricing
- Good PostgreSQL support

### Fly.io
- More deployment control
- Good for Socket.IO apps
- Faster deployments

### Heroku
- Most reliable (but pricier)
- Excellent deployment pipeline
- Great debugging tools

---

## Current State Summary

### What Works ✅
- Frontend deployed and updated
- User authentication
- Socket.IO connection
- REST API endpoints
- Database operations

### What's Broken ❌
- Object placement (authentication fails on events)
- Cursor movement (rate limited)
- Any Socket.IO events requiring auth

### What's Fixed But Not Deployed ✅❌
- id_token sanitization preservation
- Debug logging for authentication
- Token optimization (disabled)

### Blocking Issue ❌❌❌
- **Railway refusing to auto-deploy**
- **Manual deployment is ONLY path forward**

### Verification
```bash
# Confirm fix is in local code
$ git show 52c2c21:backend/app/middleware/socket_security.py | grep -A5 "SKIP_SANITIZATION"
        SKIP_SANITIZATION_FIELDS = {
            'id_token',  # Firebase JWT token - must not be modified
            'canvas_id',  # UUID/ID fields already validated by schema
            'object_id',
            'user_id',
            'invitation_id',
```

**Fix is definitely in the code.** Railway just needs to deploy it.
