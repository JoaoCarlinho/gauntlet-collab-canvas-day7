# Development Mode Fixes for Screenshot Tests

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Spinning Circle in Canvas Screenshots
**Problem**: Canvas screenshots were showing a loading spinner instead of the actual canvas content.

**Root Cause**: The CanvasPage component was checking for authentication before loading canvas data, causing development mode tests to fail.

**Solution**:
- Modified `CanvasPage.tsx` to bypass authentication checks in development mode
- Updated the useEffect that loads canvas data to allow loading without authentication in development mode
- Ensured `loadCanvas()` and `loadObjects()` are called even when user is not authenticated in development mode

### 2. Connection Lost Toast Messages
**Problem**: Canvas screenshots showed multiple "Lost connection to server" toast messages.

**Root Cause**: The application was attempting to establish WebSocket connections even in development mode, causing connection failures.

**Solution**:
- Modified `useSocket.tsx` to completely skip socket connections in development mode
- Updated `CanvasPage.tsx` to skip all socket-related operations in development mode:
  - Socket event listeners
  - State synchronization
  - Update queue management
  - Connection monitoring
  - Offline mode handling
- Added development mode checks to cleanup functions to prevent socket cleanup attempts

### 3. Test Missing Canvas Navigation
**Problem**: Multiple tests were showing spinning circles because they didn't navigate to a canvas page.

**Root Cause**: Tests were relying on previous test's page state instead of being self-contained.

**Solution**:
- Added explicit `cy.visit('/dev/canvas/test-canvas')` to all canvas-related tests:
  - `dev-objects-all-types`
  - `dev-objects-selection-and-editing`
  - `dev-objects-resizing`
  - `dev-objects-movement`
  - `dev-user-experience-complete-workflow`
  - `dev-user-experience-collaboration`
  - `dev-user-guide-complete-tools`
  - `dev-feature-showcase-complete`
- Set development mode flags in localStorage before navigation
- Added proper wait time for canvas to load

### 4. Home Page Loading Issue
**Problem**: The `dev-home-page-with-canvas-list` test was showing a spinning circle.

**Root Cause**: The `HomePage` component was only loading canvases when `isAuthenticated` was true, but in development mode, the user might not be properly authenticated.

**Solution**:
- Modified `HomePage.tsx` to bypass authentication check in development mode
- Updated the useEffect to call `loadCanvases()` when either `isDevelopmentMode()` or `isAuthenticated` is true

## Files Modified

### Frontend Components
- `src/components/CanvasPage.tsx`
  - Added development mode bypass for authentication check
  - Skipped socket operations in development mode
  - Prevented connection monitoring and offline mode in development mode
- `src/components/HomePage.tsx`
  - Added development mode bypass for authentication check
  - Modified useEffect to load canvases in development mode without authentication

### Frontend Hooks
- `src/hooks/useSocket.tsx`
  - Completely disabled socket connection in development mode
  - Set `isConnected` to `false` in development mode
  - Skipped socket event listeners in development mode

### Cypress Tests
- `cypress/e2e/dev-screenshot-generation.cy.ts`
  - Added canvas navigation to "feature showcase" test
  - Added proper wait times for canvas loading

## Development Mode Detection

Development mode is detected using the following conditions:
```typescript
const isDevelopment = import.meta.env.DEV || 
                     import.meta.env.VITE_DEBUG_MODE === 'true' ||
                     window.location.hostname === 'localhost' ||
                     window.location.hostname === '127.0.0.1'
```

## Benefits

1. **Clean Screenshots**: No more loading spinners or error toasts in development screenshots
2. **Faster Tests**: No time wasted attempting failed socket connections
3. **Isolated Tests**: Tests don't depend on backend services or authentication
4. **Better Development Experience**: Developers can work on frontend without running backend services

## Testing

All 15 screenshot generation tests now pass successfully:
- Home page screenshots
- Canvas navigation screenshots
- UI component screenshots
- Object manipulation screenshots
- User workflow screenshots
- Documentation screenshots

## Next Steps

1. Verify screenshots look correct and contain expected content
2. Consider adding more test coverage for edge cases
3. Document the development mode features in the main README
