  - Open browser developer tools
  - Check for WebSocket connection in Network tab
  - Verify connection to Railway backend
  - Check for any connection errors

- [ ] **Test object creation**:
  - Add a rectangle to the canvas
  - Verify object appears immediately
  - Check for any real-time update errors

### 4.5 Object Visibility User Story Validation
**User Story**: "As a user, I want objects to appear immediately when I add them so that I can see my changes"

- [ ] **Test immediate object visibility**:
  - Add a rectangle at position (100, 100)
  - Verify object appears immediately (no delay)
  - Add a circle at position (200, 200)
  - Verify circle appears immediately
  - Add text at position (300, 300)
  - Verify text appears immediately

- [ ] **Test object persistence**:
  - Refresh the page
  - Verify all objects are still present
  - Check object positions are correct

## Phase 5: Documentation and Summary

### 5.1 Document Results
- [ ] Record all validation results
- [ ] Note any issues or bugs found
