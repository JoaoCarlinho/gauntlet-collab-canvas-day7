# feat: Implement WebSocket-based AI Canvas Generation with Prompt Tracking

## Summary
Implements a complete WebSocket-based AI canvas generation flow with prompt tracking and database persistence, following the outlined sequence:
1. Request received by Flask endpoint
2. Instructions prepared for OpenAI model  
3. Request sent to OpenAI endpoint
4. **NEW**: WebSocket alerts frontend that generation started
5. **NEW**: WebSocket updates frontend when canvas objects are received from OpenAI
6. **NEW**: Canvas stored as child of Prompt model in Postgres

## Key Features

### Backend Implementation
- **Prompt Model & Service**: Created `Prompt` model to track AI generation requests with status tracking (pending/processing/completed/failed)
- **Database Migration**: Added migration script for `prompts` table and Canvas.prompt_id foreign key with indexes
- **WebSocket Events**: Implemented real-time status updates via Socket.IO
  - `ai_generation_started`: Emitted when request sent to OpenAI
  - `ai_generation_completed`: Emitted with generated objects
  - `ai_generation_failed`: Emitted on errors with details
- **Prompt API Routes**: Added comprehensive prompt management endpoints
  - GET /api/ai-agent/prompts - Get user's prompt history
  - GET /api/ai-agent/prompts/<id> - Get specific prompt with canvases
  - DELETE /api/ai-agent/prompts/<id> - Delete prompt
  - GET /api/ai-agent/prompts/stats - Get statistics
- **Canvas-Prompt Linking**: Canvases now reference their generating prompts via foreign key

### Frontend Implementation  
- **Real-time Status Updates**: AIAgentPanel shows live generation status (sending → processing → receiving)
- **WebSocket Integration**: Removed manual object creation loop, now receives objects via WebSocket events
- **TypeScript Types**: Added `Prompt` interface and updated `Canvas` type with optional `prompt_id`
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error context to support AI generation operations

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed unused 'user' variable in AIAgentPanel.tsx
- Added 'request_id' to AIAgentResponse interface
- Added 'ai_generation' to ErrorContext operation types
- Merged latest master changes including FloatingToolbar and NetworkStatusIndicator fixes

## Technical Changes

### Database Schema
- New `prompts` table with fields: instructions, style, color_scheme, status, request_metadata, error_message
- Canvas.prompt_id foreign key (nullable) linking AI-generated canvases to their prompts
- Indexes on user_id, status, and prompt_id for query performance

### Files Changed (16 files, +989/-83 lines)
**Backend:**
- backend/app/models/prompt.py (new)
- backend/app/services/prompt_service.py (new)
- backend/migrations/* (new migration infrastructure)
- backend/app/services/ai_agent_service.py (websocket events + prompt integration)
- backend/app/routes/ai_agent.py (prompt management routes)
- backend/app/socket_handlers/canvas_events.py (documentation)

**Frontend:**
- frontend/src/components/AIAgentPanel.tsx (websocket-based flow)
- frontend/src/services/socket.ts (AI generation event listeners)
- frontend/src/types/index.ts (Prompt interface)
- frontend/src/utils/errorLogger.ts (ai_generation operation type)
- frontend/src/hooks/useAIAgent.ts (request_id field)

## Test Plan
- [x] Verify TypeScript build passes without errors
- [ ] Test AI canvas generation with real-time status updates
- [ ] Verify WebSocket events fire in correct sequence
- [ ] Test prompt history retrieval and deletion
- [ ] Verify Canvas-Prompt linking in database
- [ ] Test error handling and failed generation scenarios
- [ ] Verify migration runs successfully on clean database

## Breaking Changes
None - All changes are additive. Existing canvases without prompt_id continue to work normally.

## Notes
- Prompt tracking is automatic - no API changes required for existing AI generation flow
- Canvas.prompt_id is nullable to support manually created canvases
- WebSocket events require active Socket.IO connection; falls back gracefully if disconnected
- Merged latest master including comprehensive error resolution fixes
