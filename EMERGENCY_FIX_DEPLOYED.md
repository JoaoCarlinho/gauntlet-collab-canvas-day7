# EMERGENCY FIX: Token Metadata Disabled to Restore Object Placement

**Date:** October 27, 2025, ~7:35 AM PDT
**Commit:** 4241c78 "CRITICAL FIX: Disable token metadata"
**Status:** PUSHED - Waiting for Railway deployment

---

## Executive Summary

**Problem:** Railway deployment pipeline is NOT updating despite multiple commits.

**Evidence:** Backend logs show old code - schema validation errors that should have been fixed 10 commits ago.

**Emergency Solution:** Disabled the token metadata fields that are causing validation errors.

**Expected Result:** Object placement should work immediately after this deployment.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue #1: Railway Deployment Pipeline Broken

**Timeline of Deployment Failures:**
```
Commit 58f9370 (5:41 AM) - Schema fixes → NOT DEPLOYED
Commit cf22959 (5:47 AM) - Empty trigger → NOT DEPLOYED
Commit 8ef0e01 (6:30 AM) - Debug logging → NOT DEPLOYED
Commit ef96777 (6:40 AM) - Force rebuild → NOT DEPLOYED
Commit 04a5058 (6:45 AM) - Cache fix → NOT DEPLOYED
Commit b1693ad (7:05 AM) - Trigger again → NOT DEPLOYED
Commit 090aee6 (7:24 AM) - Modify run.py → NOT DEPLOYED
```

**Current Railway Deployment:** Running code from BEFORE commit 58f9370

**Proof:** Console logs show `{'_token_metadata': ['Unknown field.']}`
- This error was supposed to be fixed in commit 58f9370
- Commit 58f9370 added `_token_metadata` to schema classes
- Railway is clearly not running that code

### Issue #2: Schema Validation Blocking Object Placement

**The Broken Flow:**

1. **Frontend sends Socket.IO message:**
   ```javascript
   {
     canvas_id: 'bd53004e-d17a-4090-9ee0-8a0017a3a8be',
     id_token: 'eyJ...',
     object: {...},
     _token_metadata: {...}  ← Added by token optimization service
   }
   ```

2. **Backend validation (OLD CODE) rejects message:**
   ```python
   class ObjectCreateEventSchema(BaseSocketEventSchema):
       canvas_id = fields.Str(required=True)
       id_token = fields.Str(required=True)
       object = fields.Dict(required=True)
       # _token_metadata NOT DEFINED ❌

       class Meta:
           unknown = EXCLUDE  ← Rejects unknown fields
   ```

3. **Result:** `{'_token_metadata': ['Unknown field.']}`

4. **Consequence:** Request fails at validation, never reaches authentication

5. **Final Error:** "User or canvas ID missing" (because auth never ran)

### Issue #3: Anonymous Rate Limiting

**Backend Log Evidence:**
```
Security: anonymous_rate_limit_exceeded_object_created for user anonymous:100.64.0.3
Anonymous rate limit exceeded for IP 100.64.0.3 on event object_created
```

**Why This Happens:**
- Validation fails, request never authenticated
- Backend treats event as anonymous
- Anonymous rate limit = 5 requests per 60 seconds
- User hits limit immediately with cursor movements
- All object placement blocked

---

## The Emergency Fix

### What Was Changed

**File:** `backend/app/services/token_optimization_service.py`

**Before (BROKEN):**
```python
# Apply token-specific optimizations
if token_validation['has_issues']:
    optimized_message['_token_issues'] = token_validation['issues']
    optimized_message['_token_optimization_applied'] = True

# Add token metadata for debugging
optimized_message['_token_metadata'] = {
    'size': token_validation['token_size'],
    'validated_at': time.time(),
    'has_issues': token_validation['has_issues']
}
```

**After (EMERGENCY FIX):**
```python
# TEMPORARY FIX: Disable token optimization fields until Railway deploys schema fixes
# if token_validation['has_issues']:
#     optimized_message['_token_issues'] = token_validation['issues']
#     optimized_message['_token_optimization_applied'] = True

# TEMPORARY FIX: Disable token metadata until Railway deploys schema fixes
# Railway deployment pipeline is not updating - blocking object placement
# This metadata causes schema validation errors: {'_token_metadata': ['Unknown field.']}
# TODO: Re-enable after Railway successfully deploys commit 090aee6 with schema fixes
# optimized_message['_token_metadata'] = {
#     'size': token_validation['token_size'],
#     'validated_at': time.time(),
#     'has_issues': token_validation['has_issues']
# }
```

### Why This Works

**New Flow After Fix:**

1. **Frontend sends Socket.IO message:**
   ```javascript
   {
     canvas_id: 'bd53004e-d17a-4090-9ee0-8a0017a3a8be',
     id_token: 'eyJ...',
     object: {...}
     // No _token_metadata ✅
   }
   ```

2. **Backend validation (OLD CODE) accepts message:**
   ```python
   # Schema has: canvas_id, id_token, object ✅
   # Message has: canvas_id, id_token, object ✅
   # No unknown fields ✅
   # Validation passes! ✅
   ```

3. **Authentication runs:**
   ```python
   # Check session → empty (different request context)
   # Fallback to id_token in data → FOUND ✅
   # Validate token → Success ✅
   # Add _authenticated_user to data ✅
   ```

4. **Permission check passes:**
   ```python
   user = data.get('_authenticated_user')  # Present ✅
   canvas_id = data.get('canvas_id')  # Present ✅
   # Check passes ✅
   ```

5. **Object placement succeeds! ✅**

---

## What This Sacrifices

### Lost Functionality (Temporarily)

1. **Token Optimization Metrics**
   - No longer tracking token size
   - No longer tracking validation time
   - No longer tracking token issues

2. **Token Issue Detection**
   - No longer flagging problematic tokens
   - No longer applying special handling for expired tokens

### What Still Works

1. ✅ Token validation (still happens, just no metadata added)
2. ✅ Authentication via id_token
3. ✅ Object placement
4. ✅ Cursor movement
5. ✅ All Socket.IO events
6. ✅ Rate limiting (now works correctly for authenticated users)

---

## Verification Steps After Deployment

### Step 1: Check Railway Logs

Look for new container start:
```
Starting Container
✅ Database connected successfully!
```

Timestamp should be AFTER 7:35 AM PDT.

### Step 2: Test Cursor Movement

**Watch console for:**
- ❌ `{'_token_metadata': ['Unknown field.']}` → Old code still running
- ✅ No validation errors → Fix deployed!

### Step 3: Try Object Placement

**Expected behavior:**
1. Click object tool (rectangle, circle, etc.)
2. Click on canvas
3. Object appears immediately ✅
4. No errors in console ✅
5. No errors in Railway logs ✅

### Step 4: Check Backend Logs

**Should NOT see:**
```
Security: anonymous_rate_limit_exceeded_object_created
Anonymous rate limit exceeded for IP
```

**Should see instead:**
```
Socket.IO connection authenticated for user: jskeete@gmail.com
(Object creation events processed successfully)
```

---

## Known Remaining Issues

### 1. Cache Comparison Bug (Still Present)

**Railway Log Line 20:**
```
Cache set error: '>' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
```

**What This Is:**
- Cache expiration comparison bug
- Fixed in commits 8ef0e01 and 04a5058
- Railway hasn't deployed these fixes

**Impact:**
- Cache operations may fail
- Token expiration checks affected
- Not blocking core functionality

**Status:** Will be fixed when Railway deployment pipeline fixed

### 2. Session Context Missing (Design Issue)

**Railway Log Lines 16-19, 21-24:**
```
Socket.IO connection authenticated for user: jskeete@gmail.com
Session stored with authenticated_user ✅

(Later...)
Security: anonymous_rate_limit_exceeded_object_created for user anonymous
```

**What This Means:**
- Socket.IO connection creates Flask session
- Individual Socket.IO events run in different request context
- Session not accessible in event handlers
- Fallback to id_token authentication works (after this fix)

**Impact:**
- Extra token validation on each event
- Slight performance overhead
- Functionally works correctly

**Status:** By design - Socket.IO events don't share HTTP session

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (After This Deployment)

1. ✅ Object placement should work
2. ✅ Cursor movement should work
3. ✅ All Socket.IO events should work

### Short Term (Fix Railway Deployment)

**Possible Causes of Deployment Failure:**

1. **Railway Webhook Not Receiving Pushes**
   - Check GitHub repo Settings → Webhooks
   - Look for Railway webhook
   - Check recent deliveries for errors

2. **Railway Build Cache Stuck**
   - May need manual deployment via Railway UI
   - Or contact Railway support

3. **Railway Watching Wrong Branch**
   - Verify Railway is monitoring `master` branch
   - Check Railway project Settings → GitHub

4. **Dockerfile Build Failing Silently**
   - Check Railway build logs
   - Look for Docker layer caching issues

**Actions:**
1. Monitor this deployment (commit 4241c78)
2. If this succeeds → Railway pipeline working, just slow
3. If this fails → Manual deployment required

### Medium Term (Re-enable Token Metadata)

**After Railway Deployment Fixed:**

1. Verify commit 090aee6 deployed (contains schema fixes)
2. Uncomment token metadata code in token_optimization_service.py
3. Commit and push
4. Verify schema accepts _token_metadata
5. Token optimization metrics restored

## Expected User Experience After Fix

### Before This Fix ❌
1. Load page → Authenticate → Canvas loads
2. Move cursor → Console floods with errors
3. Click to place object → Silent failure
4. Check console → "User or canvas ID missing"
5. Try again → "Anonymous rate limit exceeded"
6. Refresh page → Token expired, re-authenticate
7. Infinite loop of frustration

### After This Fix ✅
1. Load page → Authenticate → Canvas loads
2. Move cursor → No errors
3. Click to place object → Object appears!
4. Move object → Updates in real-time
5. Other users see changes live
6. Everything works smoothly

## Technical Details

### Token Optimization Service Flow

**Purpose:** Analyze tokens for optimization opportunities

**Original Implementation:**
```python
def optimize_socket_message(token, message, user_id):
    # Validate token
    validation = validate_token_for_socket(token, user_id)

    # Add metadata for debugging/metrics
    message['_token_metadata'] = {
        'size': validation['token_size'],
        'validated_at': time.time(),
        'has_issues': validation['has_issues']
    }

    # Add issue flags if needed
    if validation['has_issues']:
        message['_token_issues'] = validation['issues']

    return message
```

**Problem:** Backend schema doesn't recognize these fields

**Emergency Solution:** Don't add the fields

**Proper Solution:** Update schema to accept fields (commit 58f9370 does this, but not deployed)

### Schema Validation Flow

**Decorator Chain:**
```python
# From socket_security.py:
func = validate_socket_input(schema_class)(func)  # 1. VALIDATE
func = require_socket_auth(func)                  # 2. AUTHENTICATE
func = check_canvas_permission_decorator(func)    # 3. AUTHORIZE
func = rate_limit_socket_event(func)             # 4. RATE LIMIT
```

**Validation Step (OLD CODE - Currently Deployed):**
```python
def validate_socket_input(schema_class):
    def wrapper(data):
        schema = schema_class()
        validated_data = schema.load(data)  # Fails on unknown fields
        return func(validated_data)
```

**What Happens When Validation Fails:**
- Emits error to client
- Returns early, never calls `func`
- Authentication never runs
- Permission check never runs
- Event handler never runs

**Result:** Complete failure chain from a single validation error
